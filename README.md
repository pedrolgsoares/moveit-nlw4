## Getting Started
Before you start:
The project was created with Typescript it will be necessary to install the following dependencies through the terminal in the project directory with the command
```
npm install typescript @ types / react @ types / react-dom @ types / node -D
 if using yarn, apply:
yarn add typescript @ types / react @ types / react-dom @ types / node -D
```
It may be necessary to install a module for Cookies, run in the terminal:
```
npm install typescript js-cookie
 if using yarn, apply: 
yarn add typescript js-cookie
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
